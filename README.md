# Week 5

# Optimisation Week

This is the optimisation week. Please review the finalised code below and ensure to implement CSS Modules and at least one custom hook into your HR app.

### Key Updates:

1. **Created a `useAxios` custom hook**
   - Handles `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, and other HTTP requests.
2. **Replaced direct Axios usage**
   - Components now use the `useAxios` hook for cleaner and more reusable HTTP request handling.
3. **Implemented CSS Modules**
   - Improved modularity and scoped styles management across the application.
4. **Utilized `var()` styles in `:root`**
   - Defined reusable CSS variables for consistent theming.
5. **Rearranged file structures**
   - Improved organization and maintainability of the codebase.
6. **Developed a `useEmployeeStatus` custom hook**
   - Simplified and cleaned up the `EmployeeCard` component by extracting logic into a reusable hook.
7. **Enhanced `persons` data**
   - Added more details to the data model, enabling a richer and more informative view on the single page.
8. **Improved `Form` component**
   - Updated the form to handle new fields from the enhanced `persons` data.

### Your Next Steps:

1. Implement **CSS Modules** in your HR app to ensure scoped styling for components.
2. Refactor at least one piece of repetitive logic into a **custom hook**.
3. Update your app to use **CSS variables** (`var()`) defined in `:root` for consistency in theming.
4. Test all new changes thoroughly to ensure functionality and performance remain unaffected.
5. Push your final code to your repository and ensure all updates are well-documented.
