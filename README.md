# Week 5

Optimisation 

1. Created a `useAxios` custom hook to handle GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, and other HTTP requests.  
2. Replaced direct Axios usage in components with the `useAxios` hook.  
3. Replaced CSS with CSS Modules to improve modularity and scope management.  
4. Rearranged file structures for better organization and maintainability.  
5. Developed a `useEmployeeStatus` custom hook to simplify and clean up the `EmployeeCard` component.
