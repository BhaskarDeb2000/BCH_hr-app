# HR Application for practicing React

## Week4

### Step 1
1. Install `react-router-dom` for managing routing in your application.
2. Create pages for `Root`, `Login`, `ErrorPage`, `List`, and `Form`.
3. Set up routes:
   - `Root` will contain the `Header`, `Outlet`, and `Footer` components.
4. Test your routes by entering different paths in the URL, such as:
   - `/login`
   - `/employees`
   - `/new`
   - `/something` (to verify that the `ErrorPage` displays correctly). 


### Step 2
1. Modify the Header to include a menu with navigation links
   - employees
   - add new
2. Make sure that List component display the employees list
3. Prepare Form component
   - Add imputs for all fielts matching the data structure in `personData`
   - Add the `useState` to manage form data
   - Log the form data to the console on form submission (later we will add functionality to save the data).
